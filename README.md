## Time Complexity

Some classes of commonly encountered time complexity:

-  **Constant Time**: `O(1)`   
  It only takes a single step for the algorithm to accomplish the task.

- **Logarithmic Time**: `O(log n) `   
  The number of steps it takes to accomplish a task is decreased by some factor with each step.

-  **Linear Time**: `O(n)`   
  The number of steps required is directly related (1 to 1).

- **Quadratic Time**: `O(n²) `   
  The number of steps it takes to accomplish a task is n squared.

- **Exponential**: `O(C^n)`   
  The number of steps it takes to accomplish a task is a constant to the power of n.
  
- **Factorial**: `O(n!) `   
  The number of steps it takes to accomplish a task is a n factorial.
